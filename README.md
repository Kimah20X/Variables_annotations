Python Annotations

Description
This project demonstrates the use of Python type annotations to improve code readability and maintainability. 
Type annotations provide hints about variable types, function parameters, and return types, making it easier for developers to understand and debug code.

Features
1. Defines functions with type hints for better clarity.
2. Uses built-in and custom data types.
3. Improves code documentation and static analysis.

Requirements
Python 3.6 or later (Type hints were introduced in Python 3.5, with improvements in later versions.)

Usage
1. Clone or download the script.
2. Run the script using:
python Python\ Annotations.py
3. Modify or extend the script to explore type annotations further.

Benefits of Using Type Annotations
1. Improves code readability.
2. Helps with static type checking using tools like mypy.
3. Enhances code documentation without external documentation tools.

Contributions
Feel free to modify the script and explore more use cases. Contributions and improvements are welcome.
Note: the questions and their expected results is above every file project.
